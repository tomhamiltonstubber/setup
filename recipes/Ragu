Serves 4:

600g Sausage meat
3 tablespoons fennel seeds
1 brown onion
2 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon thyme
400g chopped tomatoes
1 small glug white wine

1. Brown the onions for 5 mins on a high heat
2. Add the fennel seeds and paprika for 1 min
3. Add the sausage meat. You want it to brown so stir it then leave it and repeat
4. Taste the meat. You might want more fennel seeds. Season with pepper and salt
5. Add the tomatoes and turn heat down
6. Reduce and add the wine

You want a good proportion of meat to pasta so I recommend less pasta - long flat pasta is good for this imo.
